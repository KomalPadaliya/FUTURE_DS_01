Project Name:
E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard

Project Description:
As part of my Task-1 at Future Interns, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze multi-year e-commerce performance data.
The goal of this project was to convert raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights that support better decision-making across sales, customer segments, product categories, and regional performance.
The dashboard provides complete visibility into sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and product performance through dynamic visualizations.

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and visualization
DAX Measures – For calculations like profit, YoY growth, return rate, segment share
Power Query – Data transformation & loading
