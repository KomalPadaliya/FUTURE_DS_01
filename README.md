Project Name:<br>
E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard

Project Description:<br>
As part of my Task-1 at Future Interns, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze multi-year e-commerce performance data.<br>
The goal of this project was to convert raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights that support better decision-making across sales, customer segments, product categories, and regional performance.<br>
The dashboard provides complete visibility into sales trends, profitability, customer behavior, and product performance through dynamic visualizations.<br>

Tools Used:<br>
Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and visualization<br>
DAX Measures – For calculations like profit, YoY growth, return rate, segment share<br>
Power Query – Data transformation & loading<br>
